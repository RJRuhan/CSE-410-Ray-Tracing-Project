# **Ray Tracing with Phong Illumination Model**  

## **Overview**  
This project implements **Ray Tracing** to render bitmap images with realistic lighting and shading. The **Phong Illumination Model** is used to simulate how light interacts with objects, creating realistic reflections and shading effects.

## **Features**  
- ✅ Ray tracing algorithm for realistic rendering  
- ✅ Phong Illumination Model (Ambient, Diffuse, and Specular lighting)  
- ✅ Support for multiple light sources  
- ✅ Ability to render spheres and planes  
- ✅ Outputs high-quality **bitmap (.bmp) images**
